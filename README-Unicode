This repository contains a unicode conversion of the CATSS morphologically-
tagged Seputagint (LXXM) [1].

The texts differ from the originals in the following ways:
  1. Several corrections have been applied.
  2. The betacode text has been converted to unicode.
  3. The files are now whitespace-separated rather than fixed-width.
  4. The second column, containing the POS and parsing information, has had its
     whitespace replaced with hyphens in accordance with the above.
  5. Combined the split files of Genesis, Psalms, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and
     Ezekiel, and renumbered all the files.

Please note that the same terms of use apply to this unicode version as to the 
original - see the 0-readme.txt and 0-user-declaration.txt files for details.

Contact Nathan Smith <nathan@smithfam.info> or the Open Scriptures email list
